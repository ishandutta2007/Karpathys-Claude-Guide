# Gemini Coder Guidelines

This document outlines a set of guidelines for effectively using Google's Gemini model for software development tasks. By following these principles, you can improve the quality of Gemini's output and make your development process more efficient.

## 1. Think Before You Code

Before you start writing any code, take the time to think about the problem you are trying to solve. This will help you to write more efficient and effective prompts for Gemini.

*   **Deconstruct the problem**: Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable pieces. This will help you to focus on one part of the problem at a time and will make it easier for Gemini to understand your request.
*   **Consider the context**: Think about the programming language, libraries, and frameworks you are using. This will help you to write more specific and accurate prompts.
*   **Define the desired output**: What do you want Gemini to generate? Be as specific as possible in your prompts.

## 2. Be Specific and Provide Context

The more specific you are in your prompts, the better Gemini will be able to understand your request and generate the correct code.

*   **Use clear and concise language**: Avoid using jargon or slang that Gemini may not understand.
*   **Provide examples**: If you have a specific format or style that you want Gemini to follow, provide an example in your prompt.
*   **Include relevant code snippets**: If you are asking Gemini to modify existing code, include the relevant code snippets in your prompt.

## 3. Iterate and Refine

Don't expect Gemini to get it right on the first try. Be prepared to iterate and refine your prompts until you get the desired output.

*   **Start with a simple prompt**: Start with a simple prompt and then gradually add more detail as you refine your request.
*   **Experiment with different prompts**: If you are not getting the desired output, try rephrasing your prompt or using different keywords.
*   **Provide feedback**: If Gemini generates incorrect code, provide feedback to the model so that it can learn from its mistakes.

## 4. You are the expert

While Gemini is a powerful tool, it is not a replacement for a skilled developer. Always review the code generated by Gemini and make sure that it meets your quality standards.

*   **Check for errors**: Always check the code generated by Gemini for errors before you use it in your project.
*   **Test the code**: Always test the code generated by Gemini to make sure that it works as expected.
*   **Make it your own**: Don't be afraid to modify the code generated by Gemini to fit your specific needs.
