# Karpathy's Claude Guide - Gemini Edition

## Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's insights on large language models, this guide provides a framework for interacting with Google's Gemini model to achieve optimal results in software development.

The goal of this guide is to provide a set of best practices and principles for developers to follow when using Gemini for code generation, debugging, and other software engineering tasks. By following these guidelines, you can improve the quality of Gemini's output and make your development process more efficient.

## Key Principles

This guide is based on the following key principles:

1.  **Think Before You Code**: Before you start writing any code, take the time to think about the problem you are trying to solve. This will help you to write more efficient and effective prompts for Gemini.
2.  **Be Specific**: The more specific you are in your prompts, the better Gemini will be able to understand your request and generate the correct code.
3.  **Provide Context**: When you are asking Gemini to write code, provide as much context as possible. This includes information about the programming language, libraries, and frameworks you are using.
4.  **Iterate and Refine**: Don't expect Gemini to get it right on the first try. Be prepared to iterate and refine your prompts until you get the desired output.
5.  **You are the expert**: While Gemini is a powerful tool, it is not a replacement for a skilled developer. Always review the code generated by Gemini and make sure that it meets your quality standards.

## How to Use This Guide
